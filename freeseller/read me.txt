mysql on cloudbees

create a database on the cloudbees server
bind the database to your app.
use the gui mysql workbench to connect to the database on the cloudbees server.
	you need to fill info such as server address, username, password etc
	port be default ie 3306  (cloudbees use the default port)

(this is how mysql works. there is a database on a server. mysql connects to that server and 
we can work on that database ie- creating table, entering data etc. by default mysql operates on 
local host. so we need to create a new  connection)

check the connection once reqd info are filled in the mysql gui.

we are now ready to work on that db
	create a table and add data
	use (url:user:password) from the cloudbees page for getting the connection
